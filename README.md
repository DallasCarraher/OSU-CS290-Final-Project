For our project, our goal was to create a website that provides users an outlet to share their favorite/trending songs of different categories and genres for others to see. Different pages visualized for the site include pages organized by genre as well as a simple user login for authoring new additions. The main data that will be stored on the back end will be the data that users submit.
