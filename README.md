For our project, we would like to create a website that gives users an outlet to share their favorite songs and media of different categories and genres for others either anonymously or with a preferred username and display them in a unique popularity-based design. Different pages for the site will include perhaps a login page and profile page for registered users as well as the main pages of clickable objects designated by genre that will redirect users to playable tracks on soundcloud, youtube, etc.
The main data that will be stored on the back end will be the form data that users are submit. An app will run on the server side which counts how many users are submitting a given track name. Additionally, information about artists, genres, and other aspects of music will be stored and can be tracked. User information, such as geographic location and music preferences, can be stored with an optional user account.
